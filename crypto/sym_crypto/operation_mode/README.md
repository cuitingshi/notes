# Intro
We have come through a long way in learning ciphers. 
Both DES and AES can work well with a fix-sized block, but either of them could handle with plaintext or ciphertext with variant size.ðŸ˜­
Furtunately, operation modes of block cipher offer us a feasible to resolve this embarrassed problem. 
Can't wait to unmask this mysterious methodðŸ˜‰
