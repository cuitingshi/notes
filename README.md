# Introduction
Recently, I tried to read the source codes of IBM hyperledger project to have a better understanding of blockchain.
I found it a need to prepare myself with some knowledge in specific fields, like cryptography. 
And it turned out that writing was an effective way.  It's not just about keeping track of what I have learned. 
Instead, as I tried to find a way to express myself more logically, those unintelligible ideas seemed to become less obscure. 
Those ephemeral thoughts just came out like a spring.üòÅ Really amazing, I should keep following it~ 
  By the way, the notes are also available as [gitbook html pages](https://xyzlol.gitbooks.io/notes/content/).
