# Intro
These notes are just a glimpse of what I have learned in these days. 
Recently, I tried to read the source codes of IBM hyperledger project to have a better understanding of blockchain.
I found it a need to prepaer myself with some knowledge in specific field, like cryptographics. 
And it turned out that writting is really a good way.  It's not just about recording those ephemeral thoughts, but as I 
try to find a way to express logically, those unintelligible ideas seems to become less obscure.

## [Cryptographic](./crypto)

## [gRPC](./grpc)
These notes focus on google Remote Procedure Call and protocol buffer.
